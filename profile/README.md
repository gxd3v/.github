# About
Well, there's really nothing special about this...

Just a bunch of projects that I think are going to be fun to develop.

The idea here is to do a bit of everything, meaning: 
  * Frontend
  * Backend
  * Database
  * Infrastructure
  * Cloud
  * DevOps
  * Wtv else there is

Every project will use websockets so each and everyone can communicate between them, and mainly with the dashboard, wich will be where one is able to start / stop a service, see the logs, run commands in the container of the service (not sure if i'm going to use docker for this)

Let's keep in mind that everything here is subject to change, I still have a lot to learn to do this projects.

# Technologies
Frontend - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) / [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) / [SkeletonUI](https://www.skeleton.dev/)

Backend - [Go](https://go.dev/)

Database - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)


# Repositories and what they're about
The names of the repos might be a bit confusing so, here's what they mean:
  * ### [gx-data-toolset](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-data-toolset)
    * Basically a toolkit to visualize and adjust data such as: beautify and minify data (json / css / js / etc.);
    * Decode and encode data to base64;
  * ### [gx-rng](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-rng)
    * There's no big deal with this project, the idea is to insert some names / options whatever, and it will randomly choose one;
  * ### [gx-slt](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-slt)
    * By far my most ambicious project, SLT stands for Sign Language Translator. Why? well, why not. I feel like I can learn alot with this project, including sign language because I know nothing about it;
  * ### [gx-pdf-merger](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-pdf-merger)
    * This idea occured while I was studying, teachers will often give 5/6/7 PDF's and I just like to be able to scroll in one big PDF instead of having to jump between files;
  * ### [gx-database-controller](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-database-controller)
    * This project will be used basically by every other project here that needs to write or read things from the database. It will start with Postgres and MongoDB and then later I might add support for other databases;
  * ### [gx-infrared-controller](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-infrared-controller)
    * I have no idea how i will do this, but i have some lamps in my room that use those common led controllers, and i want to be able to do it trough my phone;
  * ### [gx-cah](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-cah)
    * This one is literraly just for fun, cah stands for Cards against humanity, still have to think about it tho;
  * ### [gx-music-modifier](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-music-modifier)
    * I love to hear music, and more than hearing music, I love to hear the slowed+reverb versions of some musics, and sometimes it's from a not so well-known artist and there will be no version of it, so, why not just make it myself am i right?
  * ### [gx-expesnes-manager](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-expenses-manager)
    * The name is pretty self-explanatory, it's going to be an app to manage my expenses. Working with tags, like, house, food, car, animals. Creating graphs with the expesnes, setting limits to sped money on X tag;
  * ### [gx-url-shortner](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-url-shortner)
    * It shortens URL's, there's nothing much to it...
  * ### [gx-momma-recipes](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-momma-recipes)
    * This is going to be a big big one, my mom has thousands of recipes, and I want to make them all public, problem is that they are all in paper, I will have to find a productive way of transfering them from paper to digital format;
  * ### [gx-ytdl](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-ytdl)
    * This one is tricky, because youtube doesn't really allow downloads, unless the video / music is explicitly lincesed with a license that is free of known copyright, like the cc0;
  * ### [gx-yssy](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-yssy)
    * Well, yssy stands for youtube spotify spotify youtube. It will be the recreation of a project I already did, it basically converts youtube playlists to spotify playlists and vice-versa (The old one i did only converts from youtube to spotify);
  * ### [gx-chat](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-chat)
    * Basically a anonymous chat room where people can easly exchange messages without having to worry about logins and things like that;
  * ### [gx-space-visualizer](https://github.com/gxd3v/gx-space-visualizer)
    * A way to visualize the space on your disks inspired by [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/)
